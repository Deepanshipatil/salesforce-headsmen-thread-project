# salesforce-headsmen-thread-project
📘 Project Overview
The HeadsMen Thread Project is a Salesforce automation system built during my internship. It helps monitor and manage product stock levels efficiently by using Apex Batchable and Schedulable interfaces. The solution runs scheduled batch jobs to check low stock conditions and automatically updates relevant product records within the Salesforce environment.
